# BudgetQuagga

**BudgetQuagga** is a budget planner and spending tracker app made
for android devices. The app is written in Kotlin and utilises
ROOM database for storing data locally and Google maps for
gathering and displaying expense location.

The app allows users to register a new budget, which includes length of
budget as well as amount of max amount of money allowed to use during
said budget. After adding a budget the user can track their spending by
adding expenses, which can also be categorized. The app also features
a **budget overview** for easy access to details regarding a budget, as
well as an **all budget history** where the user will be able to see
all previous budgets being stored in database by swiping.

In the **Map** menu the location from which the expenses were made
will be displayed. Thus giving the user a visual representation
of where the expense happened. There's also been implemented a
**Spendometer** to give the user a visual representation using a
speedometer for how much money they've used during the active budget.

The app also features a settings menu, which gives the user the option
to delete all saved data in the database.
